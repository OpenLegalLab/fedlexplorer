# FEDLEXplorer

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Swiss federal legislation data can be used in third-party products through a SPARQL endpoint.

We are developing the frontend and backend in the respective subfolders.
In the `data` folder you can find a SPARQL query and some sample outputs.
